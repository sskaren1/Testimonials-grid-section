                    I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

                    “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
                    transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
                    for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
                    The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
                    the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                    “ Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code.I needed some structure from professionals who camp help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never has to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular was outstanding. Itook my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. IN fact, I've often to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certanly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend ”
